Note: This project is developed at [Marist College](http://marist.edu) as a working proof of concept to use [Comet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29) to see push notifications for any web based applications. To make it more useful application we planned to build xmpp client which is web based.
